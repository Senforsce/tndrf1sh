Please review the attached NDA document, and if the terms are agreeable, kindly sign and return a copy to me at your earliest convenience. If you have any concerns or require clarification on any points, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I believe that this NDA will provide a framework for a transparent and secure exchange of information during our discussions. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to the success of [Company Name] and am confident that our discussions will be mutually beneficial.
